Early-stage planning and prototyping for the CGSL Archive will be funded by an NEH [Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant](http://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-start-grants).  

---

The Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants program awards relatively small grants to support the planning stages of innovative projects that promise to benefit the humanities.

Proposals should be for the planning or initial stages of digital initiatives.

Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants should result in plans, prototypes, or
proofs of concept for long-term digital humanities projects prior to
implementation.

The proposed archive targets a particular desiderata of the DHS grant,
viz., "planning and developing prototypes of new digital tools for preserving,
analyzing, and making accessible digital resources, including libraries’ and
museums’ digital assets."

From the [FAQ](http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/digital-humanities-start-faqs_2014.pdf):

Innovation does not consist of creating new technology; instead 
the project makes use of an existing technology in a new way.

**Projects that simply use existing technologies to make materials more readily available are unlikely to receive Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants. If, however, your proposed work involves the early stages in the development of new Web technologies or new methods of indexing or incorporating metadata into an online collection, you would appear to have a stronger case for receiving a Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant.**
