# Internet Video Formats

Two formats meet the needs of most browsers:  
* H.264+AAC+MP4  
* WebM

## Is a third format necessary?

Firefox < 4.0 and Opera < 10.6 requires a third format (Theora+Vorbis+Ogg), but we shouldn't waste our resources...

Firefox < 16 accounts for 3.3% of market, what fraction uses < 4.0?  
Opera < 11.0 accounts for 0.0% of market.

## Sticking to just one format?

WebM is necessary for Firefox < 21 (6.5%) and Opera (1.6%) users  
H.264 is necessary for Safari (3.6%) and iPhone (1.03%) users

Either way, we aren't sacrificing much to get rid of one format. But which should we choose?

### License

The best thing WebM has going for it is that it's open source, but H.264's license makes it free for our purposes. 

"Only the parties at the top and bottom of the H.264 tool chain are generally required to pay royalties; that is, the party who makes the encoder, and the party who distributes the encoded file to the end users."

### Performance and Quality

H.264 encoding and decoding require far less resources than WebM. This is going to be important for video excerpts and for viewing/seeking on older machines. The compression quality of H.264 is also better, which makes it better for archival. (We'll see what MIAP says soon.) 
Encoding H.264 can be done around 1x (per core).

### Excerpts

In both WebM and H.264, minimum keyframe rate can be specified. For H.264, it's possible using [FFmpeg](https://sites.google.com/site/linuxencoding/x264-ffmpeg-mapping) with or without the x264 encoder.

### Containers

For compatibility, H.264 should be pared with AAC audio in an mp4 container:

WebM video uses Vorbis audio in a unique file format:

## Quicktime

Quicktime only supports H.264 with YUV 420 and the "main" profile, whereas the high profile may be more appropriate especially for higher resolutions.
