# CGSL Data Archive (exploratory discussion)

Notes in preparation for tomorrow's (2015-04-20) discussion, exploring the options for a CGSL data archive and funding possibilities.


## Questions

* What is the main objective of the envisioned archive?

* Who is the intended audience?  How large is this audience?

* Can you provide some examples of how this archive would be used by other
  researchers?

* Can you point to an existing model of how your archive should work and look
  like?

* What is the current state of the collections you wish to archive?

* Would this be a one-time curation and publish effort or ongoing?

* Do you have any postdocs with the relevant domain expertise to serve as leads
  in this enterprise (as archive administrator)?


## Key Considerations

Let's keep in mind the purpose and function of a scientific data archive.  A data archive for a given scientific research community provides a curated
collection of **repurposable** data collections.  Each collection should provide
a basic organization of its contents that is appropriately annotated and
documented for future users.  The aim of the annotation and docs is to clarify how the collection was used for a particular research objective and could be repurposed to address other research questions.

The archive provides ...

* preservation
* access (and access controls)
* discoverability
* explorability

... of its research collections.

We should distinguish between curating a data archive (a set of collections) and curating a particular collection.

The administrator of the data archive should provide a set of **annotation templates** (i.e., metadata forms) for any common media type found in its collections.  They should also provide guidelines and recommended structure for the organization and documentation of contributed collections.

The curation of a particular data collection is typically left to the research
group that wishes to contribute their collection to the archive. The process of curating a particular collection typically involves converting (or "transcoding") videos into a web-friendly, streaming format.  (This can often be done in batch and the RCC can assist with the video conversion process.) 

In addition to **transcoding video**, the data files in a collection need to be **organized**, **annotated**, and **documented** according to the prescribed standards or guidelines of the archive.  Research groups typically organize and document their collections for internal use, often on an ad-hoc basis or based on a loose-set of unspecified conventions.  As a result, the curation process is often just a minor reorganization of the existing collection and reformatting of existing documentation, all according to the archive's recommended guidelines.  Somewhat more involved is the task of providing the metadata annotation for each media type based on the annotation templates provided by the archive.


## Recommendations

A few recommendations to consider if funding is obtained and the CGSL wishes to proceed in creating a focused data archive for the sign and gesture research community.

* hire a postdoc as the data archive's administrator (a domain specialist)
* assign grad students or competent RAs the responsibility of curating
  collections (someone who already knows the collection)
* use databrary as infrastructure
* contract with RCC for video conversion and storage
* contract with RCC for media and communications services
* contract (or subcontract via RCC) with Web Services for front-end development
