# What makes behavioral research collections unique?

In the behavioral sciences, significant emphasis is placed on observation.  A behavioral scientist aims to confirm their hypothesis with behavioral evidence.  Given this observational imperative, a research study typically requires capturing phenomenal streams (video recordings) of the behavior of the study's participants, which must be observed and annotated in accordance with a rigorous specification of observational criteria.

* phenomenal streams (continuous / unstructured)
* observations / annotations (segmented / structured)

In other words, the data collected in the course of a study consists in part of **annotated streams** of participant behavior.  For cohort studies, these annotated streams are often called **sessions**.  This is typically supplemented with various attributes and measures collected for each **participant**.  These attributes and measures permit various participant and session **groupings**.

Note that the captured video of partipant behavior is an information channel that
requires filtering, segmentation, and decoding on the part of the researcher, whose observations are re-encoded in the form of annotations.  The annotations supervene over the raw-data stream.

Let's also note the following ...

**Observations made about human behavior are always matters of judgement and interpretation.  These assessments can always be re-evaluated.**  Was this subject producing an iconic gesture or merely aborting a reflex movement prior to a sneeze?  

Further, **these assessments can always be refined.**  For example, a researcher may want to code the verbal argument roles of utterances to see how they co-occur with certain gesture types after noticing some interesting patterns across instances.

Once a behavioral stream has been annotated (and perhaps re-evaluated and
refined), **the researcher can then use those annotations to query, filter, and transform particular slices of observed behaviors.** 

**The data collection and annotation process required to undertake a systematic study of some form of human behavior is laborious and expensive.** 

This may all seem very obvious to the behavioral researcher, but I think it's
important to highlight how behavioral research data is actually collected and
annotated, because this is what makes behavioral datasets unique.
